Used Bootstrap's grid system for responsive columns

Added custom media queries to fine-tune the layout on different screen sizes

Implemented a mobile-first approach with adjustments for larger screens

Visual Hierarchy:

Large, bold headings in the hero section to grab attention

Clear section headers with supporting text

Consistent spacing and padding throughout

Product Cards:

Clean, modern design with subtle shadows and hover effects

Badges for special items (New, Sale)

Consistent height for all cards using Bootstrap's h-100 class

Navigation:

Sticky navbar that stays visible while scrolling

Collapsible menu for mobile devices

User-friendly icons for account and cart access

Color Scheme:

Primary blue color for buttons and highlights

Dark background for footer for contrast

Light background for product section to make products stand out

Interactive Elements:

Hover effects on buttons, cards, and social icons

Smooth transitions for all interactive elements

Clear call-to-action buttons

Performance Considerations:

Used Bootstrap CDN for fast loading

Optimized images with placeholder.com for demonstration

Minimal custom CSS to keep page lightweight
